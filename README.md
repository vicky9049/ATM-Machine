# ATM-Machine

Description:

The ATM Machine System is a console-based application built in Java that simulates the basic operations of an Automated Teller Machine (ATM).
It follows Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) principles like Encapsulation and ensures secure handling of account details and balances.

The system provides a text-based user interface where users can log in using their account number and PIN. Once authenticated, users can perform essential banking operations such as viewing balance, depositing money, and withdrawing money.

Key Features:
User Authentication: Validates account number and PIN before allowing access.
Encapsulation: Account details (balance, account number, PIN) are kept private and accessed only through methods.

Core Banking Functions: View balance, deposit, and withdraw operations.

Console-Based Menu: Simple text-driven interface for usability.

Secure Data Handling: Prevents direct access to sensitive data like PIN and balance.

Technologies Used:
Programming Language: Java
Concepts: OOP (Encapsulation, Authentication)
Interface: Console-based (Text UI)
